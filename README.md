# Cloning Twitter Website #

This is a Twitter clone website, a little project I built to  learn front-end development.
At first, this was a static page, but now I'm adding more functionality to it.

### Getting Started ###

The project now uses nodeJS, so make sure you have node installed.

* sudo apt-get install node
* sudo apt-get install npm
* npm install connect
* npm install serve-static

After installing all of these, go to the project directory and run:
* nodejs server.js

then go to http://localhost:5000/index.html
