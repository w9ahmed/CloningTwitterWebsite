# Cloning Twitter Website #

This is a Twitter clone website, a little project I built to  learn front-end development.
At first, this was a static page, but now I'm adding more functionality to it.

### Getting Started ###

The project now uses nodeJS, so make sure you have node installed.

* sudo apt-get install node
* sudo apt-get install npm
* sudo npm install serve-static
